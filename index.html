            <h3>About Me</h3>
            
            <p>
                I am determined individual with deep passion of wood-working and making beautiful timeless pieces of art. 
                I have been part of Arcadian Cottage for 12 years. Arcadian Cottage specializes in handmade furniture using reclaimed barn wood that is over 100+ years old.
                The specific wood we select is becoming rare as old barns and structures slowly disappear across the United States.

                        I have experience using several different types of wood working tools from sanders and saws.
                        I use planers, miter saws, chisels etc.
